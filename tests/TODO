- Test Kafka:
    Kafka test using shell script to execute and track the container performance 
    The performance will be test within the increasement of data size and concurrency of data coming.
    Data size will increase from 1KB to 1GB, with exponential increase.
    Concurrency will increase from 1 to 2
    Then we test for the data integrity and latency

- Test Spark:
    Spark test using Apache Bench to execute and track the system performance based on the local Hadoop base.
    The performance will be test within the increasement of data size and concurrency of data coming.
    Data size will increase from 1KB to 10GB, with exponential increase.
    Data synthetic or duplicated Sentiment140 dataset
    Spark will load and perform data retrieval and be tracked the performance executor memory/cpu bottlenecks.


- Test Elasticsearch:
    Using rally tool to test the scalaility of elastic search, which have been up in docker container.
    The performance will be test based on the query time of a text at different number of records in an index.

<!-- Using Rally and apache bench -->
